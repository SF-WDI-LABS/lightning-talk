# Lightning Talks

Create a 5 minute presentation on a topic that is useful to your fellow developers. Talking about technology is one of the most difficult skills for new developers to get comfortable with, and it's one employers value highly.

In your presentation, answer the following questions:

- What problem does this technology solve?
- How do you use it? (Is there a "cheatsheet" you found or made that others can reference?)
- What did you build?

Your presentation should also include a small demo of working code. 

Please [create a brief github gist](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists/) (or "cheat sheet") for your fellow developers, outlining your findings, and linking to any helpful tutorials, resources, hints, and tips you discover in your research.
